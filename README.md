## General Assembly - Project One

# Overview

For Project One, I deceided to create the classic game of Connect Four.

Once user enters the site. User will see a combination of game title as well as the gameboard. To start the game, user will have to click on the start button. Once 'Start' button is clicked, the game will begin with the color 'Red' always as player one. Once player one has gone player two, default 'yellow', will go. Player one and player two will continue to take turns until one player has won or the game has been tied. A player can win when he/she has connected four of their game pieces in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
